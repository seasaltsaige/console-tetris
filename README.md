## What is this? Why did I make it?
This repository is my attempt at reacreating the classic game Tetris. I tried to make my version of the game as close to the original game as I could, its not perfect, but I can still improve it over time. I made it because I felt like giving myself a challenge and it's honestly just a fun game and now I can play my own version of it whenever I want to. It was a fun adventure making this.

## Can I play this?
Yeah of course! Just follow the steps for installing it on your own computer!
- Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) V15.4.0 or higher or you may encounter errors.
```cmd
$ git clone https://github.com/Maxisthemoose/console-tetris.git
$ npm install
$ npm run
```

## What are the controls?
To move the pieces left and right, use the A and D keys. To hard drop a piece, press the down arrow. To move a piece down faster, use the S key. To rotate the pieces left and right, use the Left and Right arrow keys.

And that should basically be it! Enjoy your classic game of Tetris!
